# ⌨️ *Space*

## 📌 General Overview

**Space** is an arcade game featuring two gameplay modes: **Endless** and **Story Mode**. The player defends against waves of enemies by typing words on the keyboard and sending them with the **Space** key. To deal damage, the word must be typed **correctly**—any error forces the player to retype the entire word.

Each enemy requires a different strategy: some are defeated quickly, others demand speed or endurance. In **Story Mode**, players face a series of enemies and a final boss. In **Endless Mode**, players battle until defeat—surviving as long as possible.
